phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000008	bulliform flabellate	Heavily built, solid phytolith, tabular, flabellate. The lower part of this fan-shaped  morphotype is markedly narrower than the upper part. The outline of the upper part is generally  convex and may be facetate. In some cases, the top of the upper part can be truncated, resulting in  a flat to concave face. The sides of the lower part can be straight to concave. The outline of the  base can be straight to typically convex. The phytolith is often symmetrical along an axis from top  to base [vertical length (VL); Fujiwara, 1993], but can also be asymmetrical. The surface is  typically psilate. For definitions of the different lengths used to measure this morphotype see also  Fujiwara (1993).
