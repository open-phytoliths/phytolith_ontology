phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000005	acute bulbosus	Unarticulated, solid body with a generally narrower, acute part (referred to as the apex), and another, wider part (referred to as the antapex). The antapex is hemi-spheroidal (rounded), truncated hemispheroidal, or has a near-parallelepipedal to fusiform shape with more or less pointed ends. The apex can be straight or curved, with a sharp or rounded tip. It often forms an angle of less than 90 o with the long axis of the antapex, resulting in a markedly asymmetrical, roughly triangular shape in side view. The body overall consists of granular or homogenous silica, typically obscure and/or maculose. The antapex can have multiple simple or dendritic processes covering part of its surface.

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000006	papillate	Circular to oval (“saucer-shaped”, Parry and Smithson, 1966) plate (antapex) with a short, conical, blunt or pointy protrusion (apex) in the center where the plate is thickest. The protrusion points obliquely at an angle <90˚ with the plane of the plate. The plate is made up of smooth, homogeneous opaque material and ranges from being very thin and transparent to being thickened and (at higher magnification) laminated in cross section (with lamination parallel to the surface). In cases when the entire perimeter of the plate is silicified, its edges can be sinuate, sometimes with small circular holes/pits.

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000007	blocky	: BLOCKY encompasses compact, heavily built, solid phytoliths with length/width <2, and width and thickness roughly equal. In 3-D perspective the overall shape resembles a parallelepiped (a 6-faced parallelogram), although there can be more faces. The faces may be flat, slightly convex or concave. The edges of the faces are sharp or blunt. From a 2-D perspective some BLOCKY present four or more sides. Some BLOCKY have projections at the edges, ridges, facets or protrusions that may appear as dentate margins in certain views. They may also show slightly uneven or velloate edges corresponding to the intersection of formerly adjacent cells. Surfaces can be psilate, granulate, or columellate.

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000008	bulliform flabellate	Heavily built, solid phytolith, tabular, flabellate. The lower part of this fan-shaped morphotype is markedly narrower than the upper part. The outline of the upper part is generally convex and may be facetate. In some cases, the top of the upper part can be truncated, resulting in a flat to concave face. The sides of the lower part can be straight to concave. The outline of the base can be straight to typically convex. The phytolith is often symmetrical along an axis from top to base [vertical length (VL); Fujiwara, 1993], but can also be asymmetrical. The surface is typically psilate. For definitions of the different lengths used to measure this morphotype see also Fujiwara (1993).

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000009	elongate entire	ELONGATE ENTIRE has an overall rectilinear 2D outline and highly variable sizes. Slightly arcuate elongated phytoliths with more or less parallel long sides are also included. L:W is characteristically ≥2. The margins are smooth, without distinct projections or indentations, but sometimes slightly uneven or velloate, corresponding to the inter-section of formerly adjacent cells. Ends can be concave, convex, straight, rounded or tapering. Their transverse section can range from angular (e.g., rectangular) or circular to oblong in shape. Thickness can range from thinly tabular to robustly thick. Their surface texture can range from psilate to granulate. Often observed as single cells, but also occurring articulated, arranged in parallel or longitudinal consecutive  patterns.

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000010	elongate sinuate	Tabular, with an overall rectilinear to nearly rectilinear 2D outline. L:W is ≥2. The margins of the long sides (rarely the short sides) are distinctly sinuate, with alternating convexities and concavities. The amplitude and periodicity of the undulating concavities and convexities are variable and can be regular or irregular. Undulations can range from slightly too well developed, in the latter case sometimes becoming clavate to columnar to castellate. Surface texture can vary widely including psilate, granulate, papillar, and striate. Often observed as single cells, but also occurring articulated.

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000011	elongate dendate	Elongated, with a rectilinear to nearly rectilinear 2D outline. L:W is ≥2. The margins of the long side (rarely, if ever on the short side) in 2D view are dentate, i.e. they have acute, sometimes carinate projections. Their thickness can range from thinly tabular to robustly thick. Surface texture is typically psilate, but sometimes granulate, or papillar. Often observed as single cells, but also occurring articulated.
