phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000007	blocky	Blocky encompasses compact, heavily built, solid phytoliths with length/width <2, and width and thickness roughly equal. In 3-D perspective the overall shape resembles a parallelepiped (a 6-faced parallelogram), although there can be more faces. The faces may be flat, slightly convex or concave. The edges of the faces are sharp or blunt. From a 2-D perspective some blocky present four or more sides. Some blocky have projections at the edges, ridges, facets or  protrusions that may appear as dentate margins in certain views. They may also show slightly uneven or velloate edges corresponding to the intersection of formerly adjacent cells. Surfaces can  be psilate, granulate, or columellate.

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000008	bulliform flabellate	Heavily built, solid phytolith, tabular, flabellate. The lower part of this fan-shaped morphotype is markedly narrower than the upper part. The outline of the upper part is generally convex and may be facetate. In some cases, the top of the upper part can be truncated, resulting in a flat to concave face. The sides of the lower part can be straight to concave. The outline of the base can be straight to typically convex. The phytolith is often symmetrical along an axis from top to base [vertical length (VL); Fujiwara, 1993], but can also be asymmetrical. The surface is typically psilate. For definitions of the different lengths used to measure this morphotype see also Fujiwara (1993).

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000009	elongate entire	Elongate entire has an overall rectilinear 2D outline and highly variable sizes. Slightly arcuate elongated phytoliths with more or less parallel long sides are also included. L:W is characteristically is greater or equal to 2. The margins are smooth, without distinct projections or indentations, but sometimes slightly uneven or velloate, corresponding to the inter-section of formerly adjacent cells. Ends can be concave, convex, straight, rounded or tapering. Their transverse section can range from angular (e.g., rectangular) or circular to oblong in shape. Thickness can range from thinly tabular to robustly thick. Their surface texture can range from psilate to granulate. Often observed as single cells, but also occurring articulated, arranged in parallel or longitudinal consecutive patterns.

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000010	elongate sinuate	Tabular,  with  an  overall  rectilinear  to  nearly  rectilinear  2D  outline. L:W  is  greater  or  equal  to  2. The  margins  of  the  long  sides (rarely  the  short  sides)  are  distinctly  sinuate,  with  alternating  convexities and  concavities. The  amplitude  and  periodicity  of  the  undulating  concavities  and  convexities  are  variable  and  can  be  regular  or  irregular. Undulations  can  range  from  slightly  too  well  developed,  in  the latter  case  sometimes  becoming  clavate  to  columnar  to  castellate.  Surface  texture  can  vary  widely  including  psilate,  granulate,  papillar,  and  striate. Often  observed  as single cells, but  also  occurring  articulated.

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000011	elongate dendate	Elongated,  with  a  rectilinear  to  nearly  rectilinear  2D  outline.  L:W  is  greater  or  equal  to  2.  The  margins  of  the  long  side  (rarely,  if  ever  on  the  short  side)  in  2D  view  are  dentate,  i.e.  they  have  acute,  sometimes  carinate  projections. Their  thickness  can  range  from  thinly  tabular  to  robustly  thick.  Surface  texture  is  typically  psilate,  but  sometimes  granulate,  or papillar.  Often  observed  as  single  cells,  but  also  occurring  articulated.

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000012	elongate dentritic	Elongate, with a rectilinear to nearly rectilinear 2D outline. L:W is greater or equal to 2. Elongate dentritic typically have branched processes extending laterally away from both of their longer sides. Processes may also be observed extending laterally from the shorter ends of the phytolith.sides. Though typically branched, the processes may range from branched once or multiple times to unbranched (i.e., dentate) on a single phytolith. The apices of the processes range from rounded to acute or dentate.

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000013	tracheary	Shape varies from being more or less cylindric and elongate to more compact and polyhedral. Cylindric elongate bodies range from being relatively straight, with consistent diameter and unbranched to being any or all of irregular, ellipsoidal, brachiform, and having soft facets. Ends can be straight, rounded, or pointed/tapering. Phytoliths can consist of one or multiple of these bodies in articulation. The characteristic feature of the morphotype is the surface decoration. In TRACHEARY ANNULATE/HELICAL this consists of ring-to helical-shaped ridges arranged perpendicular to the long axis, more  or less regularly and densely distributed over the entire phytolith and appearing in side view as castellate protrusions at the long edges. In TRACHEARY PITTED, surface decoration consists of circular to oval projections in surface view, more or less densely distributed on the surface. In closer 3D-view these projections can show some variation, e.g. pilate, gibbate, or tuberculate, but never dendritic. They can be regularly arranged in vertical rows along the length of the phytolith or be less regularly arranged. In TRACHEARY BORDERED, surface decoration is characterized by small (2-4 microns), convex discs with a centrally located, nipple-like knob that are commonly found in pairs on either side of the surface of the body as a whole, sometimes in addition to annulate/helical ridges. Included in TRACHEARY are also transitional forms, for example morphotypes in which the ridges do not encircle the cylinder, but appear as narrow ellipses or oblong shapes on the surface of the body (oriented perpendicular to the long axis), as well as forms that are both annulate/helical and pilate. If a subtype cannot be clearly identified, the more general name TRACHEARY should be given.The silicification of the TRACHEARY as a whole ranges from a thin interior layer with a hollow center to a completely infilled body.

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000014	saddle	Symmetrical morphotype described as resembling a saddle (e.g., Metcalfe, 1960) or a battle axe with double edges (Prat, 1948), in planar view consisting of two more or less convex faces connected by concave faces. In side view, both IPS and OPS are concave; in end view, IPS and OPS are and shape, giving the body nearly three planes of symmetry. SADDLE encompasses morphotypes with the convex faces (slightly) shorter than, or equal to thetypically convex. In planar view, IPS and OPS have the same, or nearly the same, size concave faces, sometimes referred to as tall saddle, as well as forms with longer convex faces, so-called squat saddles (Piperno and Pearsall, 1998: Figs. 18-20).

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000015	bilobate	Morphotype whose OPS consists of two lobes separated by two indentations or a distinct castula, with length greater than or equal to 1.3 the width of the lobes (planar view). OPS ends convex, straight, or concave (planar view). IPS variable in shape (bilobate, angular, to carinate in IPS view), size relative to OPS, and degree and type of ornamentation (e.g., ridges, tubercles). Thickness variable.

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000016	polylobate	Morphotype consisting of two end-lobes separated by a castula, along which are inserted additional, distinctly separated lobes (in effect a BILOBATE with additional lobes attached along an extended castula). Castula-lobes can be of similar size or smaller than end lobes and either paired (present on both sides of the castula) or unpaired. Both IPS and OPS are lobed in shape, although the IPS can be less well defined in castula areas. IPS can be ornamented (e.g., ridges, tubercles).	Celine Kerfant		Nodular	Metcalfe, 1960, Figs.

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000017	cross	Morphotype whose OPS consists of three or more (typically four) roughly equal lobes separated by three or more (typically four) indentations.

IPS variable in shape (e.g., cross, rectangular, rounded, carinate), size relative to OPS, and degree of ornamentation (e.g., facets, flange-like extensions, tubercles).
