phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000005	acute bulbosus	Unarticulated, solid body with a generally narrower, acute part (referred to as the apex), and another, wider part (referred to as the antapex). The antapex is hemi-spheroidal (rounded), truncated hemispheroidal, or has a near-parallelepipedal to fusiform shape with more or less pointed ends. The apex can be straight or curved, with a sharp or rounded tip. It often forms an angle of less than 90 degrees with the long axis of the antapex, resulting in a markedly asymmetrical, roughly triangular shape in side view. The body overall consists of granular or homogenous silica, typically obscure and/or maculose. The antapex can have multiple simple or dendritic processes covering part of its surface.

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000006	papillate	Circular to oval (“saucer-shaped”, Parry and Smithson, 1966) plate (antapex) with a short, conical, blunt or pointy protrusion (apex) in the center where the plate is thickest. The protrusion points obliquely at an angle <90 degrees with the plane of the plate. The plate is made up of smooth, homogeneous opaque material and ranges from being very thin and transparent to being thickened and (at higher magnification) laminated in cross section (with lamination parallel to the surface). In cases when the entire perimeter of the plate is silicified, its edges can be sinuate, sometimes with small circular holes/pits.
