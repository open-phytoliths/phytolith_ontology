phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000007	blocky	Blocky encompasses compact, heavily built, solid phytoliths with length/width <2, and width and thickness roughly equal. In 3-D perspective the overall shape resembles a parallelepiped (a 6-faced parallelogram), although there can be more faces. The faces may be flat, slightly convex or concave. The edges of the faces are sharp or blunt. From a 2-D perspective some blocky present four or more sides. Some blocky have projections at the edges, ridges, facets or  protrusions that may appear as dentate margins in certain views. They may also show slightly uneven or velloate edges corresponding to the intersection of formerly adjacent cells. Surfaces can  be psilate, granulate, or columellate.

phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000008	elongate entire	Elongate entire has an overall rectilinear 2D outline and highly variable sizes.  Slightly arcuate elongated phytoliths with more or less parallel long sides are also included. L:W  is characteristically â‰¥2. The margins are smooth, without distinct projections or indentations, but  sometimes slightly uneven or velloate, corresponding to the inter-section of formerly adjacent cells.  Ends can be concave, convex, straight, rounded or tapering. Their transverse section can range  from angular (e.g., rectangular) or circular to oblong in shape. Thickness can range from thinly  tabular to robustly thick. Their surface texture can range from psilate to granulate.  Often observed as single cells, but also occurring articulated, arranged in parallel or longitudinal consecutive  patterns.
