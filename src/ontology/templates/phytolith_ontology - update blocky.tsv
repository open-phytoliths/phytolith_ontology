phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000007	blocky	Blocky encompasses compact, heavily built, solid phytoliths with length/width <2, and width and thickness roughly equal. In 3-D perspective the overall shape resembles a parallelepiped (a 6-faced parallelogram), although there can be more faces. The faces may be flat, slightly convex or concave. The edges of the faces are sharp or blunt. From a 2-D perspective some blocky present four or more sides. Some blocky have projections at the edges, ridges, facets or  protrusions that may appear as dentate margins in certain views. They may also show slightly uneven or velloate edges corresponding to the intersection of formerly adjacent cells. Surfaces can  be psilate, granulate, or columellate.
