phytolith:PHYTOLITH_0000025	acute bulbosus	Unarticulated, solid body with a generally narrower, acute part (referred to as the  apex), and another, wider part (referred to as the antapex). The antapex is hemi-spheroidal  (rounded), truncated hemispheroidal, or has a near-parallelepipedal to fusiform shape with more or  less pointed ends. The apex can be straight or curved, with a sharp or rounded tip. It often forms  an angle of less than 90 degrees with the long axis of the antapex, resulting in a markedly asymmetrical,  roughly triangular shape in side view. The body overall consists of granular or homogenous silica,  typically obscure and/or maculose. The antapex can have multiple simple or dendritic processes  covering part of its surface.
